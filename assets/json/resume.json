This framework adapts recent developments in automatic, unsupervised segmentation of time-series to humanoid robotics by preprocessing the data obtained from a broad range of the robot's sensors, to then repropduce the learned task in similar environments. In more detail, we reproduce and extend the acquired multi-step task using Dynamic Movement Primitives in simulation for the JVRC1 Robot, and further validate it the segmentation process in real world with the HRP-4C Robot, thus showcasing the possibility to create an extensive library of reusable skills for complex humanoids with our approach."}],"skills":[{"name":"AI and Visual Computing","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Probabilistic Graphical Models","Advanced 3D graphics","Deep Learning for topological data","Methods in Neuroscience","Deep Reinforcement Learning","Deep Learning and Generative Models"]},{"name":"CyberPhysical systems","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Safe Intelligent Systems","Computer Architecture","Compilation","Internet of Things"]}],"languages":[{"language":"French","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""},{"language":"Spanish","fluency":"Intermediate (B2)","icon":""},{"language":"Japanese","fluency":"Begginer/Intermediate (A2/B1)","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"Neuroscience","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag"},{"name":"History of Art","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Doing side-projects on tessellations (like Escher's)"],"url":"https://mcescher.com/gallery/symmetry/"},{"name":"Cinema","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag"}]}
