I am thrilled to annouce that I joined Google Deepmind as a co-advised PhD student to advance AI towards human intelligence. My work lies at the intersection of foundation models, multimodal AI, video understanding and planning. I am lucky to be supervised by Ahmet Iscen, Mathilde Caron and Cordelia Schmid at Google, and by GÃ¼l Varol on the academic side in the IMAGINE group at Ecole des Ponts.
